# File Type Rules

## markdown (\*.md)

Identify where we break the following guidelines a suggest improvements.

Say the most important thing first
The goal of technical writing is to be precise and concise

Paragraphs are the primary unit of composition
One clear topic per paragraph
Set the tone for a paragraph with an initial topic sentence
Or build to a final topic sentence
Ideally, your paper can be understood by reading just the topic sentences of each paragraph.

Don’t say anything before it can be understood
Show your intent early
Find the simple essence!
Expect to re-think and re-write until your paper is as simple as it ought to be
Find your voice; stand with your reader; you know some things they don’t, so you are telling them
Avoid weak verbs (like ‘has’ and ‘is’): Weak: She has a music talent. Strong: She excels in music.
You lose half your readers with each equation
Omit unnecessary words and ideas, and use simple language
Avoid metaphorical language
Avoid superlatives that weaken (like “very” or “highly”)
Beware of careless exaggeration
Don’t say anything that is Arguably Not True (ANT)
Don’t say anything whose Opposite is Also True (OAT)
Words should be used for their literal meanings
Avoid etc/and so on, instead give clear examples.
Avoid contractions like don’t or isn’t
Don't use FANBOYS (for and nor but or yet, or so)
Avoid terms like good, bad, better, worse, and simplistic/subjective adjectives.
Avoid “they”
Avoid passive voice
Avoid the second person
Avoid should, would, might, hope, believe, think

Separate what can be separated, these let the reader rest and free their short-term memory; separate:
prior work from your work
algorithms from environments
problems from solution methods
results from conclusions (using tense)
exposition from argument
speculations from claims
what you have shown from what you have suggested
your motivations from your ambitions

Use tense consistently and thoughtfully to make distinctions
Algorithms, environments, ideas, issues, and conclusions should be in the present tense
Experiments and results should be in the past tense
Use tense to telegraph whether you are describing results (past tense) or concluding your results (present tense)
Save the future tense for the real future. Don’t use it for things that just appear later in the document

Your choices of vocabulary are critical

Often explicit definitions are needed and helpful; use italics for them
Use definitions to say what you mean by the words in this document
Even if you are not making a formal definition, it is helpful to allocate words to ideas
When assigning a word to an idea, it is usually best to explain your idea first, then attach the word (rather than the other way around)
Do not define too many things.

Mind the elementary rules of usage, including:
Use a comma before 'and' only when connecting independent clauses (which have their subject)
Use 'that' and 'which' correctly (one specifies, the other notes)
Use commas (or parentheses) around parentheticals
Amongst near-synonyms, choose the most specific word for your meaning. For example, don’t use 'since' for 'because', or ‘continuous’ for ‘continual’.
Use the short forms ‘i.e.’ and ‘e.g.’ only in parentheses, and always follow with a comma
Use the Oxford comma (as in a, b, and c)
Never use a citation as part of a sentence
Use citations thoughtfully (what is their meaning? Is it clear?)
Don’t cite a textbook for an idea unless it’s the source.
Use quotation marks only for genuine quotations; no scare quotes!
If a sentence has an ‘if’, then it should always have a ‘then’
Punctuate equations so that they are parts of the sentences
If a sentence is completely clear without commas, then it may be best to omit them
Don’t begin a sentence with mathematical notation or an equation number
Numbered things, like Chapter 3, are capitalized. Same for Section, Figure, Equation, Table.
If you number your equations like (3), then refer to them like (3)
